		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<div class='main_body'>
			<p>
				I grew up in Michigan and attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor for my bachelor's degree. Although I started college pursuing Cellular and Molecular Biology, I uncovered an interest for the field of Medical Sociology in an introductory sociology class during my sophomore year of college. It not only ignited in me a passion to improve health but provided me with the skills and knowledge of social determinants to do so.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having had separate experiences in many different fields, I sought out a graduate program that would teach me to integrate my skills and interests and apply them in a, personally and professionally, meaningful way. The Master of Health Informatics program at Michigan fit the bill perfectly. Although I still have one more year of classes before I graduate, I have already learned to apply my wide variety of expertise to the field of health informatics in ways that I could not have imagined.
			</p>
			<p>
				During my first semester in the health informatics program, I took a data manipulation course that introduced me to the field of data analytics. I was inspired by the infinite insights that we can draw from data and its importance in health care. I hope to participate in an internship this summer to further explore my passion for health data analytics and develop the technical skills that I have learned in my graduate career.
