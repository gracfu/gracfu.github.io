		<h2>Do-theDoc</h2>
		<p>This project was a semester-long assignment for a consulting course during the first semester of my Master's program, titled <em>SI 501: Contextual Inquiry and Consulting Foundations</em>. My team of four was paired with Do-theDoc, a company that offers a free, HIPAA-compliant online delivery service for dental offices.</p>
		
		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>Ever since changes were made to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in 2013, health care organizations have been subject to stricter regulations regarding patient privacy and security.  In the past, this could easily be done by email but the new regulations require sensitive information to be sent through encryption. Do-theDoc's product, Send-theDoc, helps these organizations by providing a secure way to send and receive electronic protected health information (ePHI).</p>
		<p>Send-theDoc is being used primarily in Michigan but has users in over 30 American states. Despite their success, they were seeking to attract more users to their service; according to their website analytics, only a small percentage of users who visit their website end up signing up as clients. Our team was assigned the task of identifying challenges to their user conversion rate and recommending steps that they take to improve this metric.</p>
		
		<h3>Process</h3>
		<p>Our process to achieve this goal was composed of many different steps, outlined below:
			<ul>
				<li>Background Research</li>
				<li>Interviews with Current Users</li>
				<li>Interview Annotations and Assessments</li>
				<li>Affinity Wall and Brainstorming</li>
				<li>Final Reporting</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Deliverables and Takeaways</h3>
		<p>By the end of the semester, our team produced a concise and comprehensive final report that summarized our process, our findings, and our recommendations. Our client was happily surprised with our results!</p>
		<p>Overall, the project was difficult but extremely satisfying. I learned a lot about how I work in a team setting and how to handle challenges in groupwork. The class also gave me experience working with a client and provided insight into managing client needs and expectations.</p>
